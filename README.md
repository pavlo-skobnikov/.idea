# ideavim

My personal configuration for the IdeaVim plugin in IntelliJ IDEA.

A lot of the mappings were initially inspired by the
[Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) configuration framework. However, over time,
this configuration has evolved to suit my personal needs and preferences.

## Requirements

For the configuration to fully work, you need to have the following plugins installed in IDEA:
- [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) (duh!).
- [Which-Key](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15976-which-key).

## Mentions

Special thanks go to:
- [@Marcoleni](https://github.com/MarcoIeni) and his
  [intellimacs](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/intellimacs) project.

I wouldn't have had the required patience to search up all the action mappings in IntelliJ IDEA 
myself, so, I ended up using this repository as a reference for my own 
[.ideavimrc](.ideavimrc) configuration file.
